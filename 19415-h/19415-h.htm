<h2><a name="LIBRARIES" id="LIBRARIES"></a>LIBRARIES.</h2>


<p>A library may be considered from two very different points of view: as a
workshop, or as a Museum.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FEELINGS ABOUT</i></div>

<p>The former commends itself to the practical turn of mind characteristic of
the present day; common sense urges that mechanical ingenuity, which has
done so much in other directions, should be employed in making the
acquisition of knowledge less cumbrous and less tedious; that as we travel
by steam, so we should also read by steam, and be helped in our studies by
the varied resources of modern invention. There lies on my table at this
present moment a <i>Handbook of Library Appliances</i>, in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> fifty-three
closely printed pages are devoted to this interesting subject, with
illustrations of various contrivances by which the working of a large
library is to be facilitated and brought up to date. In fact, from this
point of view a library may be described as a gigantic mincing-machine,
into which the labours of the past are flung, to be turned out again in a
slightly altered form as the literature of the present.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LIBRARIES.</i></div>

<p>If, on the other hand, a library be regarded as a Museum&mdash;and I use the
word in its original sense as a temple or haunt of the Muses&mdash;very
different ideas are evoked. Such a place is as useful as the other&mdash;every
facility for study is given&mdash;but what I may call the personal element as
affecting the treasures there assembled is brought prominently forward.
The development of printing, as the result of individual effort; the art
of bookbinding, as practised by different persons in different countries;
the history of the books themselves, the libraries in which they have
found a home, the hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> that have turned their pages, are there taken
note of. Modern literature is fully represented, but the men of past days
are not thrust out of sight; their footsteps seem to linger in the rooms
where once they walked&mdash;their shades seem to protect the books they once
handled. What Browning felt about frescoes may be applied&mdash;<i>mutatis
mutandis</i>&mdash;to books in such an asylum as I am trying to portray:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wherever a fresco peels and drops,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wherever an outline weakens and wanes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the latest life in the painting stops,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stands One whom each fainter pulse-tick pains:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One, wishful each scrap should clutch the brick,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each tinge not wholly escape the plaster,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lion who dies of an ass's kick,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The wronged great soul of an ancient Master.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ROMAN</i></div>

<p>It may be safely asserted that at no time has a love of reading, a desire
to be fairly well-informed on all sorts of subjects, been so widely
diffused as at the present day. As a necessary consequence of this the
'workshop' view of a library has been very generally accepted. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> have no
wish to undervalue it; I only plead for the recognition of another
sentiment which may at times be overlaid by the pressure of daily
avocations. In Cambridge, at least, there is no fear that it should ever
be obliterated altogether, for we have effected a happy alliance between
the present and the past, by which neither is neglected, neither is unduly
prominent. This being the case, it has occurred to me that I may be so
fortunate as to interest a Cambridge audience while I set before them some
of the results at which I have arrived in investigating the position, the
arrangement, and the fittings of libraries in the medieval and renaissance
periods. It will, of course, be impossible to attempt more than a sketch
of so extensive a subject, and I fear that I must omit the contents of the
bookcases altogether; but I shall hope, by a selection of typical
illustrations, to make you realise what some of the libraries, monastic,
public, or private, that fall within my period were like.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LIBRARIES.</i></div>

<p>I must begin with a few words about Roman libraries, because their methods
influenced the Middle Ages, and are, in fact, the precursors of those in
fashion in our own times. The Romans preserved their books in two ways:
either in a small room or closet, for reading elsewhere; or in a large
apartment, fitted up with greater or less splendour, according to the
taste or the means of the possessor, in which the books were doubtless
studied as in a modern library. An instructive example of the former class
was one of the first discoveries at Herculaneum in 1754. It was a very
small room, so small in fact that a man who stood with his arms extended
in the centre of it could almost touch the walls on either side, yet 1700
rolls were found in it. These were kept in wooden presses (<i>armaria</i>)
which stood against the walls like a modern bookcase. Besides these a
rectangular case occupied the central space, with only a narrow passage to
the right and left between it and the wall-cases. These cases<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> were about
a man's height, and had been numbered. It may be concluded from this that
a catalogue of the books had once existed. In larger libraries the books
were kept in similar presses, but they were ornamented with the busts or
pictures of illustrious men, under each of which was a suitable
inscription, usually in verse.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ROMAN</i></div>

<p>No ancient figure of one of these book-presses has been preserved, so far
as I have been able to ascertain; but, as furniture is apt to retain its
original forms with but little variation for a very long period, a
representation of a press containing the four Gospels, which occurs among
the mosaics in the Mausoleum of the Empress Galla Placidia at Ravenna,
though it could not have been executed before the middle of the fifth
century, may be taken as a fairly accurate picture of the book-presses of
an earlier age. It is unnecessary to describe it, for it is exactly like a
still later example which I am about to shew you. This picture occurs at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the beginning of the MS. of the Vulgate called the <i>Codex Amiatinus</i>,
which is now proved to have been written in England, at Wearmouth or
Jarrow, but probably by an Italian scribe, shortly before 716. The seated
figure represents Ezra writing the Law.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BOOK-PRESSES.</i></div>

<div class="padding"><p class="center"><i>Bookcase in the Codex Amiatinus: from Garrucci, "Storia dell' arte
Cristiana,"</i> iii. pl. 126.</p></div>

<p>To get an idea of one of the larger Roman libraries in ancient times we
cannot do better than turn to that of the Vatican at the present day. It
was fitted up as we see it now&mdash;with presses, busts, and antique vases, by
Pope Sixtus V., in 1588. It is therefore, at best, only a modern antique;
but arranged so skilfully that an ancient Roman, if he could come to life
again, might imagine himself in his own library.</p>

<div class="padding"><p class="center"><i>Interior of part of the Vatican Library.</i></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>RULE OF S. BENEDICT.</i></div>

<p>The library-era, as we may call it, of the Christian world, began with the
publication of the Rule of S. Benedict, early in the sixth century. But,
just as that Rule emphasized and arranged on the lines of an ordered
system observances which had long been practised by isolated congregations
or individuals living in solitude&mdash;so the part of it which deals with
study was evidently no new thing. S. Benedict did not invent literature or
libraries; he only lent the sanction of his name to the study of the one
and the formation of the other. That libraries existed before his period
is proved by allusions to them in the Fathers and other early writers;
but, as those allusions are general, and say nothing from which either
their size or their arrangement can be inferred, I shall dismiss them in
very few sentences. The earliest is said to have been the collection got
together at Jerusalem, by Bishop Alexander, at the beginning of the third
century. Another was founded about fifty years later at C&aelig;sarea by
Origen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> This is described as not only extensive, but remarkable for the
importance of the manuscripts it contained. Others are recorded at Hippo,
at Cirta, at Constantinople, and at Rome, where both S. Peter's and the
Lateran had their special collections of books. I suspect that all these
libraries were in connexion with churches, possibly actually within their
walls. At Cirta, for example, it is recorded that during the persecution
of 303-304 the officers "went to the church where the Christians used to
assemble, and spoiled it of chalices, lamps, etc., but when they came into
the library (<i>bibliothecam</i>), the presses (<i>armaria</i>) there were found
empty." This language seems to imply that the sacred vessels and the books
were in different parts of the same building. The instructions, again, of
the dying Augustine, who bequeathed his library to the church at Hippo,
lead to the same conclusion. The library of S. Peter's at Rome, though
added to the basilica erected by Constantine, long after its primitive
foundation, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> on the ground-floor in the angle between the nave and the
north limb of the transept, a position which may perhaps have been
selected in accordance with early usage.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LIBRARIES IN CHURCHES.</i></div>

<p>I now pass to the treatment of books in the libraries of the monastic
orders. These either adopted the Rule of S. Benedict, or based their own
Rule upon its provisions. It will therefore be desirable to examine what
he said on the subject of study, and I will translate a few lines from the
48th chapter of his Rule, <i>Of daily manual labour</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RULE OF S. BENEDICT.</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Idleness is the enemy of the soul; hence brethren ought, at
certain seasons, to occupy themselves with manual labour, and
again, at certain hours, with holy reading....</p>

<p>Between Easter and the calends of October let them apply
themselves to reading from the fourth hour till near the sixth
hour. After the sixth hour, when they rise from table, let them
rest on their beds in complete silence; or, if any one should wish
to read to himself, let him do so in such a way as not to disturb
any one else....</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>HIS INFLUENCE.</i></div>

<p>From the calends of October to the beginning of Lent let them
apply themselves to reading until the second hour.... During Lent,
let them apply themselves to reading from morning until the end of
the third hour ... and, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> these days of Lent, let them receive a
book apiece from the library, and read it straight through. These
books are to be given out at the beginning of Lent. It is
important that one or two seniors should be appointed to go round
the monastery at the hours when brethren are engaged in reading,
in case some ill-conditioned brother should be giving himself up
to sloth or idle talk, instead of reading steadily; so that not
only is he useless to himself, but incites others to do wrong.</p></div>

<p>"Behold! how great a matter a little fire kindleth!" These simple words,
uttered by one who in power of far-reaching influence has had no equal,
gave an impulse to study in the ages it once was the fashion to call dark
which grew with the growth of the Order&mdash;till wherever a Benedictine house
arose&mdash;or a monastery of any one of the Orders which were but off-shoots
from the Benedictine tree&mdash;books were multiplied, and a library came into
being, small indeed at first, but increasing year by year, till the
wealthier houses had gathered together a collection of books that would do
credit to a modern University.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MONASTIC CUSTOMS.</i></div>

<p>It is very interesting to notice, as Order after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> Order was founded, a
steady development of feeling with regard to books, and an ever increasing
care for their safe-keeping. S. Benedict had contented himself with
general directions for study; the Cluniacs prescribe the selection of a
special officer to take charge of the books, with an annual audit of them,
and the assignment of a single volume to each brother; the Carthusians and
the Cistercians provide for the loan of books to extraneous persons under
certain conditions&mdash;a provision which the Benedictines in their turn
adopted. Further, by the time that the Cluniac Customs were drawn up in
the form in which they have come down to us, it is evident that the number
of books exceeded the number of brethren; for both in them, and in the
statutes which Lanfranc promulgated for the use of the English
Benedictines in 1070, the keeper of the books is directed to bring all the
books of the House into Chapter, after which the brethren, one by one, are
to bring in the books they had borrowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> on the same day in the previous
year. Some of the former class of books were probably service-books, but,
after this deduction has been made, we may fairly conclude that by the end
of the eleventh century Benedictine Houses possessed two sets of books:
(1) those which were distributed among the brethren; (2) those which were
kept in some safe place, probably the church, as part of the valuables of
the House: or, to adopt modern phrases, they had a lending library and a
library of reference. The Augustinians go a step farther than the
Benedictines and the Orders derived from them, for they prescribe the kind
of press in which the books are to be kept. Both they and the
Premonstratensians permit their books to be lent on the receipt of a
pledge of sufficient value. Lastly, the Friars, though they were
established on the principle of holding no possessions of any kind, soon
found that books were indispensable; that, in the words of a Norman
Bishop, <i>Claustrum sine armario, castrum sine armamentario</i>. So,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> by a
strange irony, it came to pass that their libraries excelled those of most
other Orders, as Richard de Bury testifies in the <i>Philobiblon</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DISTRIBUTION OF BOOKS.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE MENDICANT ORDERS.</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Whenever we turned aside to the cities and places where the
Mendicants had their convents ... we found heaped up amidst the
utmost poverty the utmost riches of wisdom....</p>

<p>These men are as ants ever preparing their meat in the summer, and
ingenious bees continually fabricating cells of honey.... And to
pay due regard to truth, although they lately at the eleventh hour
have entered the Lord's vineyard ..., they have added more in this
brief hour to the stock of the sacred books than all the other
vine-dressers; following in the footsteps of Paul, the last to be
called but the first in preaching, who spread the gospel of Christ
more widely than all others.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>USE OF THE CLOISTER.</i></div>

<p>It might have been expected, from the use of the word <i>library</i> in the
Rule of S. Benedict, that a special room assigned to books would have been
one of the primitive component parts of every Benedictine House. This,
however, is not the case. Such a room does usually occur in these Houses,
but it will be found, on examination, that it was added to some previously
existing structure in the fourteenth or fifteenth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> century. Its absence
from the primitive plan brings out two points very clearly: (1) how few
books even a wealthy community could afford to possess for several
centuries after the foundation of the Order; (2) how strictly the Order
adhered to prescribed arrangements in laying out its Houses, for even
those built, or rebuilt, after books had become plentiful, do not admit a
Library as an indispensable item in their ground-plan.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BOOK-PRESSES.</i></div>

<p>How then did they bestow their books after they had become too numerous to
be kept in the church? The answer to this question is a very curious one,
when we consider what our climate is, and indeed what the climate of the
whole of Europe is, during the winter months. The centre of the monastic
life was the cloister. Brethren were not allowed to congregate in any
other part of the conventual buildings, except when they went into the
frater, or dining-hall, for their meals, or at certain hours in certain
seasons into the warming-house (<i>calefactorium</i>). In the cloister<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
accordingly they kept their books; and there they sat and studied, or
conducted the schooling of the novices and choir-boys in winter and in
summer alike.</p>

<p>Such a locality as this could not have been very favourable to the
preservation of the books themselves. They, however, had a certain amount
of protection which was denied to their readers, for they were shut up in
presses. The word used for these, <i>armarium</i>, is the same as that which
was applied by the Romans to their bookcases; and probably the idea of
such a piece of furniture was due to a far-off echo of ancient usage. The
official who had charge of the books did not derive his name from them, as
in modern times, but from the presses which contained them&mdash;for he was
uniformly styled <i>armarius</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CARRELLS AND PRESSES AT DURHAM.</i></div>

<p>As time went on, greater comfort was introduced. The windows of the walk
of the cloister where the presses stood, usually the walk next the Church,
were glazed&mdash;and sometimes not merely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> with white glass, but with mottoes
alluding to the authors whose works were near at hand; while in some
monasteries the elder monks were provided with small wooden studies,
called "carrells." A description of the whole system has been preserved
for us in that curious book <i>The Rites of Durham</i>; but it must be
remembered that this represents the customs of the convent just before the
suppression, and therefore gives no idea of the rigour of an earlier time.</p>

<div class="padding"><p class="center"><i>Part of the north walk of the cloister, Durham.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the north syde of the Cloister, from the corner over against

<p>No example of an English monastic book-press has survived, so far as I
have been able to discover; but it would be rash to say that none exists.
Meanwhile I will shew you a French example of a press, from the sacristy
of the Cathedral at Bayeux, but I cannot be sure that it was originally
intended to hold books. M. Viollet-Le-Duc, from whom I borrow it, decides
that it was probably made early in the thirteenth century.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>OF CLOISTER AT WORCESTER.</i></div>

<p>The Durham <i>Rites</i> speak only of book-presses standing in the cloister
against the walls;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> but it was not unusual to have recesses in the wall
itself, fitted with shelves, and probably closed by a door. Two such are
to be seen at Worcester, immediately to the north of the chapter-house
door. Each is about ten feet wide by two feet deep.</p>

<div class="padding"><p class="center"><i>Book-recess, east walk of the cloister, Worcester.</i></p></div>

<p>A similar receptacle for books seems to have been contemplated in
Augustinian Houses, for in the Customs of the Augustinian Priory of
Barnwell, written towards the end of the thirteenth century, the following
passage occurs:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The press in which the books are kept ought to be lined inside
with wood, that the damp of the walls may not moisten or stain the
books. This press should be divided vertically as well as
horizontally by sundry partitions, on which the books may be
ranged so as to be separated from one another; for fear they be
packed so close as to injure each other, or delay those who want
them.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CISTERCIAN PRACTICE.</i></div>

<p>Recesses such as these were developed in Cistercian houses into a small
square room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> without a window, and but little larger than an ordinary
cupboard. In the plans of Clairvaux and Kirkstall this room is placed
between the chapter-house and the transept of the church; and similar
rooms, in similar situations, have been found at Fountains, Beaulieu,
Tintern, Netley, etc. The catalogue, made 1396, of the Cistercian Abbey at
Meaux in Holderness, now totally destroyed, gives us a glimpse of the
internal arrangement of one of these rooms. The books were placed on
shelves against the walls, and even over the door. Again, the catalogue of
the House of White Canons at Titchfield in Hampshire, dated 1400, shews
that the books were kept in a small room, on shelves there called
<i>columpn&aelig;</i>, set against the walls. It is obvious that no study could have
gone forward in such places as these; they must have been intended for
security only, and to replace the wooden presses used elsewhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LIBRARIES IN FIFTEENTH CENTURY.</i></div>

<p>As time went on, the number of the books would naturally increase, and by
the beginning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> of the fifteenth century the larger monasteries at least
had accumulated many hundred volumes. For instance, at Christ Church,
Canterbury, at the beginning of the 14th century, there were 698. These
had to be bestowed in various parts of the House without order or
selection,&mdash;in presses set up wherever a vacant corner could be found&mdash;to
the great inconvenience, we may be sure, of the more studious monks, or of
scholars who came to consult them. To remedy such a state of things a
definite room was constructed for books&mdash;in addition to the presses in the
cloister, which were still retained for the books in daily use. A few
instances of this will suffice. At Christ Church, Canterbury, a library
was built between 1414 and 1443 by Archbishop Chichele, over the Prior's
Chapel; at Durham between 1416 and 1446 by Prior Wessyngton, over the old
sacristy; at Citeaux in 1480, over the writing-room (<i>scriptorium</i>); at
Clairvaux between 1495 and 1503, in the same position; at S. Victor in
Paris&mdash;an Augustinian House&mdash;between 1501<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> and 1508; and at S. Germain des
Pr&eacute;s in the same city about 1513, over the south cloister.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>S. GERMAIN DES PR&Eacute;S.</i></div>

<p>Most of us, I take it, have more or less imperfect ideas of the appearance
of a great monastery in the days of its completeness; and information on
this point is unfortunately much more defective for our own country than
it is for France. In illustration, therefore, of what I have been saying
about the position of monastic libraries, I will next shew you two
bird's-eye views of the Benedictine House of S. Germain des Pr&eacute;s, Paris.
The first, dated 1687, shews the library over the south walk of the
cloister, where it was placed in 1513. It must not, however, be supposed
that no library existed before this. On the contrary, the House seems to
have had one from the first foundation, and so early as the thirteenth
century it could be consulted by strangers, and books borrowed from it.
The second view, dated 1723, shews a still further extension of the
library. It has now invaded the west side of the cloister, which has
received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> an upper storey, and even the external appearance of the
venerable refectory, which was respected when nearly all the rest of the
buildings were rebuilt in a classical style, has been sacrificed to a
similar gallery. The united lengths of these three rooms must have been
little short of 324 feet. This library was at the disposal of all scholars
who desired to use it. When the Revolution came it contained more than
49,000 printed books, and 7000 manuscripts. The fittings belonged to the
period of its latest extension: they appear to have been sumptuous, but
for my present object, uninteresting.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHRIST CHURCH, CANTERBURY.</i></div>

<div class="padding"><p class="center"><i>Views of S. Germain des Pr&eacute;s:</i> (1) <i>from Franklin, "Anciennes
Biblioth&egrave;ques de Paris,"</i> i. 126; (2) <i>from Bouillart, "Histoire de
l'Abbaye de S. Germain des Pr&eacute;z."</i></p></div>

<p>At Canterbury the library, built as I have said, over the Prior's Chapel,
was 60 feet long, by 22 feet broad; and we know, from some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> memoranda
written in 1508, when a number of books were sent to be bound or repaired,
that it contained sixteen bookcases, each of which had four shelves. I
have calculated that this library could have contained about 2000 volumes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CITEAUX.</i></div>

<p>I have shewn you a Benedictine House, and will next shew you a bird's-eye
view of Citeaux, the parent house of the Cistercian Order, founded at the
close of the eleventh century. The original was taken, so far as I can
make out, about 1500, at any rate before the primitive buildings had been
seriously altered. The library here occupied two positions&mdash;under the roof
between the dormitory and the refectory (which must have been extremely
inconvenient); and subsequently it was rebuilt in an isolated situation on
the north side of the second cloister, over the writing-room
(<i>scriptorium</i>). This was also the position of the new library at
Clairvaux&mdash;the other great Cistercian House in France&mdash;the fame of which
was equal to, if not greater than, that of Citeaux. Of this latter library
we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> have two descriptions; the first written in 1517, the second in 1723.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CLAIRVAUX.</i></div>

<div class="padding"><p class="center"><i>View of Citeaux: from Viollet-Le-Duc, "Dictionnaire de l'Architecture,"</i>
i. 271.</p></div>

<p>The former account, by the secretary of the Queen of Sicily, who visited
Clairvaux 13 July 1517, is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On the same side of the cloister are fourteen studies, where the
monks write and study, and over the said studies is the new
library, to which one mounts by a broad and lofty spiral staircase
from the aforesaid cloister. This library is 189 feet long, by 17
feet wide. In it are 48 seats (<i>bancs</i>), and in each seat 4
shelves (<i>poulpitres</i>) furnished with books on all subjects, but
chiefly theology; the greater number of the said books are of
vellum, and written by hand, richly storied and illuminated. The
building that contains the said library is magnificent, built of
stone, and excellently lighted on both sides with fine large
windows, well glazed, looking out on the said cloister and the
burial-ground of the brethren.... The said library is paved
throughout with small tiles adorned with various designs.</p></div>

<p>The description written in 1723, by the learned Benedictines to whom we
owe the <i>Voyage Litt&eacute;raire</i>, is equally interesting:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CLAIRVAUX.</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>From the great cloister you proceed into the cloister of
conversation, so called because the brethren are allowed to
converse there. In this cloister there are 12 or 15 little cells,
all of a row, where the brethren formerly used to write books; for
this reason they are still called at the present day the
writing-rooms. Over these cells is the Library, the building for
which is large, vaulted, well lighted, and stocked with a large
number of manuscripts, fastened by chains to desks; but there are
not many printed books.</p></div>

<p>In the great cloister, on the side next the Chapter House, the same
observer noted "books chained on wooden desks, which brethren can come and
read when they please." The library was for serious study, the cloister
for daily reading, probably in the main devotional.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.</i></div>

<p>If my time were unlimited I could describe to you several other fifteenth
century monastic libraries, but I feel that I must content myself with
only one more&mdash;that of the Franciscan House in London, commonly called
Christ's Hospital. The first stone of this library was laid by Sir Richard
Whittington, 21 October, 1421, and by Christmas Day in the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> year
the roof was finished. Stow tells us that it was 129 feet long by 31 feet
broad; and the Letters Patent of Henry the Eighth add that it had 28
desks, and 28 double settles of wainscot. The whole building&mdash;so well
worth preservation&mdash;has been totally destroyed, but I am able to shew you
a view of it.</p>

<div class="padding"><p class="center"><i>Library of Christ's Hospital: from Trollope's "History of Christ's
Hospital,"</i> p. 105.</p></div>

<p>This view is an excellent illustration of the point on which I have
insisted, namely, that in the course of the fifteenth century the great
religious Houses&mdash;no matter to what Order they belonged&mdash;found that their
books had become too numerous for the localities primitively intended for
them, and began to build special libraries&mdash;usually over some existing
structure; or&mdash;in other words&mdash;established a library of reference, which
was not unfrequently thrown open to scholars in general, who were allowed
to borrow books from it, on execution of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> indenture, or deposit of a
sufficient pledge. "It is safer to fall back on a pledge, than to proceed
against an individual," said the Customs of the Priory at Abingdon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ANALOGY BETWEEN</i></div>

<p>In what way were these monastic libraries fitted up? No trace of any
monastic fittings has survived, so far as I am aware, either in England,
or in France, or in Italy; and even M. Viollet-Le-Duc dismisses "The
Library" in a few brief sentences, of which the keynote is despair. My own
view is that a close analogy may be traced between the fittings of
monastic libraries and those of collegiate libraries; and that when we
understand the one we shall understand the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MONASTERIES AND COLLEGES.</i></div>

<p>The collegiate system was in no sense of the word monastic, indeed it was
to a certain extent established to counteract monastic influence; but it
is absurd to suppose that the younger communities would borrow nothing
from the elder&mdash;especially when we reflect that the monastic system had
completed at least<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> seven centuries of successful existence before Walter
de Merton was moved to found a college; that many of the subsequent
founders of colleges were churchmen, if not actually monks; and that there
were monastic colleges at both Universities. Further, as we have seen that
study was specially enjoined upon the monks by S. Benedict, it is
precisely in the direction of study that we should expect to find common
features in the two sets of communities. And this, in fact, is what came
to pass. An examination of the statutes affecting the library in the codes
imposed upon the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge shews that their
provisions were borrowed directly from the monastic Customs. The
resemblances are too striking to be accidental. Take, for instance, this
clause, from the statutes of Oriel College, Oxford, dated 1329:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COLLEGE STATUTES.</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The common books (<i>communes libri</i>) of the House are to be brought
out and inspected once a year, on the feast of the Commemoration
of Souls [2 November], in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> presence of the Provost or his deputy,
and of the Scholars [Fellows].</p>

<p>Every one of them in turn, in order of seniority, may select a
single book which either treats of the science to which he is
devoting himself, or which he requires for his use. This he may
keep until the same festival in the succeeding year, when a
similar selection of books is to take place, and so on, from year
to year. If there should happen to be more books than persons,
those that remain are to be selected in the same manner.</p></div>

<p>Bishop Bateman&mdash;who had been educated in the priory at Norwich, and whose
brother was an abbot&mdash;gave statutes to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1350,
with similar provisions, and the addition that certain books "are to
remain continuously in the library-chamber, fastened with iron chains, for
the common use of the Fellows." These were copied by Wykeham at New
College, Oxford, but with extended provisions for lending books to
students, and a direction that all the books "which remain unassigned
after the Fellows have made their selection are to be fastened with iron
chains, and remain for ever in the common Library." This statute was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
repeated at King's College, Cambridge, and at several colleges in Oxford.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ANNUAL AUDIT OF BOOKS.</i></div>

<p>Let me now remind you of Archbishop Lanfranc's statute for English
Benedictines, dated 1070, which was based, as he himself tells us, on the
general monastic practice of his time:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On the Monday after the first Sunday in Lent, before brethren come
into the Chapter House, the librarian (<i>custos librorum</i>) shall
have had a carpet laid down, and all the books got together upon
it, except those which a year previously had been assigned for
reading. These brethren are to bring with them, when they come
into the Chapter House, each his book in his hand....</p>

<p>Then the librarian shall read a statement as to the manner in
which brethren have had books during the past year. As each
brother hears his name pronounced he is to give back the book
which had been entrusted to him for reading; and he whose
conscience accuses him of not having read the book through which
he had received, is to fall on his face, confess his fault, and
entreat forgiveness.</p>

<p>The librarian shall then make a fresh distribution of books,
namely, a different volume to each brother for his reading.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EARLIEST BOOK-DESK.</i></div>

<p>You will agree with me, I feel sure, that this statute, or similar
provisions extracted from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> other regulations, is the source of the
collegiate provisions for an annual audit and distribution of books; while
the reservation of the undistributed volumes, and their chaining for
common use in a library, was in accordance with the unwritten practice of
the monasteries. This being the case I think that we are justified in
assuming that the internal fittings of the libraries would be identical
also; and it must be further remembered that both collegiate and monastic
libraries were being fitted up during the same period, the fifteenth
century.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EARLIEST BOOK-DESK.</i></div>

<p>When books were first placed in a separate room, fastened with iron
chains, for the use of the Fellows of a college or the monks of a convent,
the piece of furniture used was, I take it, an elongated lectern or desk,
of a convenient height for a seated reader to use. The books lay on their
sides on the desk, and were attached by chains to a horizontal bar above
it. There were at least two libraries in this University fitted with such
desks, at the colleges of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> Pembroke and Queens'; and that it was a common
form abroad is proved by its appearance in a French translation of the
first book of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> <i>Consolations of Philosophy</i> of Boethius, which I
lately found in the British Museum<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, executed towards the end of the
fifteenth century (fig. 1).</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 1. Interior of a library: from a MS. of a French translation of the first book of the Consolations of Philosophy of Boethius.</span>
</div>

<p>One example at least of these fittings still exists, in the library
attached to the church of S. Wallberg, at Zutphen in Holland. This library
was built in its present position in 1555, but I suspect that some of the
fittings, those namely which are more richly ornamented, were removed from
an earlier library. Each of these desks is 9 feet long by 5 feet 6 inches
high; and, as you will see directly, a man can sit and read at them very
conveniently. I shall shew you first a general view of part of the library
(fig. 2); and, secondly, a single desk (fig. 3).</p>

<p>Such cases as these must have been in use at the Sorbonne, where a library
was first established in 1289 for books chained for the common convenience
of the Fellows (<i>in communem sociorum utilitatem</i>). A description of this
library, based probably on records now lost, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>has been given by Claude
H&eacute;m&eacute;r&eacute; (Librarian 1638-1643) in his MS. history. This I proceed to
translate:</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 3. Desk in the library at Zutphen: from a photograph.</span>
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The old library was contained under one roof. It was firmly and
solidly built, and was 120 feet long by 36 feet broad. Further,
that it might be the more safe from the danger of being burnt,
should any house in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> neighbourhood catch fire, there was a
sufficient interval between it and every dwelling-house. Each side
was pierced with 19 windows of equal size, that plenty of daylight
both from the east and the west (for this was the direction of the
room) might fall upon the desks, and fill the whole length and
breadth of the library. There were 28 desks, marked with the
letters of the alphabet, five feet high, and so arranged that they
were separated by a moderate interval. They were loaded with
books, all of which were chained, that no sacrilegious hand might
[carry them off. These chains were attached to the right-hand
board of every book] so that they might be readily thrown aside,
and reading not be interfered with. Moreover the volumes could be
opened and shut without difficulty. A reader who sat down in the
space between two desks, as they rose to a height of five feet as
I said above, neither saw nor disturbed any one else who might be
reading or writing in another place by talking or by any other
interruption, unless the other student wished it, or paid
attention to any question that might be put to him. It was
required, by the ancient rules of the library, that reading,
writing, and handling of books should go forward in complete
silence.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LIBRARY OF THE SORBONNE.</i></div>

<p>This system must have been very wasteful as regards space; for only a few
volumes, say a couple of dozen, could be accommodated on a single desk. As
books accumulated therefore some other form of case had to be devised,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
which would accommodate more volumes than could be consulted at once. The
desk could not be dispensed with so long as books were chained, but one or
more shelves were added to it. This addition was effected in two ways,
according as the books were to stand on their ends, or to lie on their
sides.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MERTON COLLEGE, OXFORD.</i></div>

<p>As an illustration of the former plan I will take the library of Merton
College, Oxford, attributed by tradition to William Reade, Bishop of
Chichester 1368-85; and it has been so little altered that it may be taken
as a type of a medieval collegiate or monastic library. It is a long
narrow room, as all medieval libraries were, with equidistant windows, and
the bookcases stand at right angles to the walls in the spaces between
each pair of windows, in front of which is the seat for the reader. Each
bookcase had originally two shelves only above the desk. I will shew you,
first, a general view of the interior of this library, and then a single
bookcase and seat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHAINING OF BOOKS.</i></div>

<div class="padding"><p class="center"><i>Merton College, Oxford: (1) general view of the interior of the Library;
(2) a single bookcase as at present.</i></p></div>

<p>The system of chaining, as adopted in this country, would allow of the
books being readily taken down from the shelves, and laid on the desk for
reading. One end of the chain was attached to the middle of the upper edge
of the right-hand board; the other to a ring which played on a bar set in
front of the shelf on which the book stood. The fore-edge of the books,
not the back, was turned forwards. A swivel, usually in the middle of the
chain, prevented tangling. The chains varied in length according to the
distance of the shelf from the desk. The bar was kept in place by a rather
elaborate system of iron-work attached to the end of the bookcase, and
secured by a lock which often required two keys&mdash;that is, the presence of
two officials&mdash;to open it. To illustrate this I will shew you a sketch of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
one of the bookcases in Hereford Cathedral (fig. 4).</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 4. Bookcase in Hereford Cathedral. (Lent by the Syndics of the University Press.)</span>
</div>

<p>Having said thus much about chaining, I return to the Merton bookcases.
Cases similar to these were evidently in use in the library of Christ
Church, Canterbury, where the memoranda I mentioned record four
shelves&mdash;that is, two on each side&mdash;in each bookcase, and also at
Clairvaux, where a similar feature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> was observed. The design was evidently
much admired, for we find cases on a similar plan, but larger, elsewhere
in Oxford, as at the Colleges of Corpus Christi, S. John's, Trinity,
Jesus, and in the Bodleian Library.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TRINITY HALL, CAMBRIDGE.</i></div>

<div class="padding"><p class="center"><i>Bookcase in the Library of Corpus Christi College, Oxford.</i></p></div>

<p>Another device for combining desk with shelf is to be seen at Trinity
Hall, Cambridge, and, as these cases were set up after 1626, we have here
a curious instance of a deliberate return to ancient forms. There is
evidence that there once existed below the shelf a second desk, which
could be drawn in and out as required, so that a reader could stand or sit

<p>The University of Leiden in Holland adopted a modification of this design,
for there the shelf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> is above the desk, and readers could only stand to
use the books (fig. 5).</p>

<p>An arrangement analogous to this was adopted at Citeaux, as we may gather
from the catalogue, drawn up in 1480. I will not trouble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> you with
details, but merely say that there was evidently a shelf below the desk as
well as one above it. The cases therefore resembled those at Leiden, with
this difference; and they were also probably of such a height that a
reader could conveniently sit at them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LIBRARY AT CESENA.</i></div>

<p>On the continent, where elaborate bindings came early into fashion,
sometimes protected by equally elaborate bosses at their corners, it would
have been impossible to arrange the volumes as we did side by side on the
shelves. It therefore became the fashion to place a shelf below the desk,
and to lay the books upon it on their sides. The earliest library fitted
in this manner that I have been able to discover is at Cesena in North
Italy. It was built in 1452, by Domenico Malatesta Novello, for the
convent of S. Francesco. It is possible, therefore, that the parent house
of S. Francesco at Assisi, which had a large library, divided, so early as
1381, into a <i>Libreria publica</i> and a <i>Libreria secreta</i>, had similar
bookcases. I am going to shew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> you a general view of the room, which has a
thoroughly medieval character, next the cases (fig. 6), and thirdly a
single book with its chain (fig. 7). You will observe that the seats for
the reader are no longer independent, but are combined with the bookcase.</p>

<p>These cases no doubt suggested those in the Medicean library at Florence,
begun in 1525 by Michael Angelo. The cases, perhaps the finest specimens
in existence of wood-carving as applied to this style of work, were
designed by other artists shortly after the completion of the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<div class="padding"><p class="center"><i>Bookcase in the Medicean Library at Florence.</i></p></div>

<p>In English libraries at least bookcases arranged on what I may term the
Oxford type were in general use throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. The invention of printing had largely increased the number of
volumes, and at the same time diminished their value, so that chaining was
no longer necessary. When it had been abandoned neither a desk, nor a seat
in close proximity to the books, was required. In consequence, though
libraries continued to be built on the ancient type with numerous windows
close to the floor, it was possible to alter the old cases, or to make new
ones, with a far larger number of shelves than heretofore; and when
further space for books was needed, low cases were interposed between each
pair of tall ones. A splendid specimen of this treatment is to be seen at
S. John's College, Cambridge, where the bookcases were put up soon after
the completion of the library in 1628.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> Though the plinth and central
pilaster have been taken away, and the levels of the shelves changed,
their original appearance can be recovered at a glance. On the top of all
the low cases there was a desk, in memory of that of ancient times. At the
end of the taller cases is a panel to contain the catalogue, here closed
by a small door.</p>

<div class="padding"><p class="center"><i>Bookcases in S. John's College Library.</i></p></div>

<p>Sometimes, as we see at Peterhouse, ancient usage asserted itself so far
that a seat was contrived by making the plinth of the tall case project to
a sufficient distance. These bookcases were set up between 1641 and 1648.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PETERHOUSE.</i></div>

<div class="padding"><p class="center"><i>Bookcase in Peterhouse Library.</i></p></div>

<p>When the necessity for still further space for books became imperative,
the seat was given up, or was dropped to the height of a step, as in the
bookcases in the south room of the University<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> Library, Cambridge, put up
soon after 1649. The carved wing, however, which had masked the ends of
it, was retained as an ornament, both there and in the old library at
Pembroke College, Cambridge, furnished soon after 1690.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE ESCURIAL.</i></div>

<p>Meanwhile a new system of arranging bookcases had come into use on the
continent. So far as I have been able to discover, the first library
arranged in the way with which we are familiar, namely, with the bookcases
set against the walls instead of at right angles to them, is that of the
Escurial. These cases were made by Herrera, the architect of the building,
in 1584. There is no indication of chaining, but, in conformity with
ancient usage, the fore edge of the books, instead of their backs, is
turned outwards, and the desk is represented by a shelf, carried all round
the room at a convenient height. No doubt so important a structure as
this, erected by so mighty a potentate as the King of Spain, would be much
talked about, and provoke imitators. Among these, I feel sure, was
Cardinal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> Mazarin, whose library was fitted up in Paris in or about 1647,
as a library to be used daily by the public. After his death his books and
bookcases were moved to the building in which they may still be seen. I
will now shew you views of the two libraries, and you shall decide whether
it is not obvious that the one was suggested by the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BIBLIOTH&Egrave;QUE MAZARINE.</i></div>

<div class="padding"><p class="center"><i>Interior of the Library of the Escurial and of the Biblioth&egrave;que Mazarine,
Paris.</i></p></div>

<p>The new system was not accepted hastily. I believe that Sir Christopher
Wren, when he built Trinity College Library in 1695, was the first English
architect who ventured to build a library with windows which, as he says
himself, "rise high, and give place for the deskes against the walls." I
suspect that he borrowed this latter idea from France, which he visited in
1665, and most likely from the Biblioth&egrave;que Mazarine, for he has himself
recorded his admiration for "the masculine furniture of the Palais
Mazarin," though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> he does not specially mention the library. But he did
not discard the ancient arrangement altogether. On the contrary he
utilised it so far as to subdivide the room, and provide recesses for the
convenience of students. He says:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TRINITY COLLEGE LIBRARY.</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The disposition of the shelves both along the walls and breaking
out from the walls must needes prove very convenient and
gracefull, and the best way for the students will be to have a
litle square table in each celle with 2 chaires. The necessity of
bringing windowes and dores to answer to the old building leaves
two squarer places at the endes, and 4 lesser celles not to study
in, but to be shut up with some neat lattice dores for archives.</p></div>

<div class="padding"><p class="center"><i>One compartment of Trinity College Library.</i></p></div>

<p>I need hardly say that neither this library, nor any of those built by
Wren's pupils or imitators, shew traces of chaining. The old fashion,
however, lingered. In 1651 Humphrey Cheetham directed the books he gave to
certain specified parish-churches near Manchester to be chained; in 1694
James Leaver gave books to the grammar-school at Bolton in Lancashire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
which were chained in a cupboard very like the <i>armarium</i> of a monastic
cloister;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PRIVATE LIBRARIES.</i></div>

<div class="padding"><p class="center"><i>Book-cupboard and desk at Bolton, Lancashire. The former is lettered:
"The gift of Mr James Leaver, citison of London 1694."</i></p></div>

<p>and at All Saints Church, Hereford, a collection of books bequeathed in
1715 was chained to ordinary shelves set against the walls, as may still
be seen. This very obvious way of disposing of books evidently shocked
old-fashioned people, for Cole the antiquary, writing in 1703, could still
speak of the arrangement of shelves against the walls as <i>&agrave; la moderne</i>.</p>

<p>The libraries I have been describing were more or less public, and I
should like, before I conclude, to shew you how books were bestowed in the
studies of individual scholars&mdash;whether royal, monastic, or secular.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ISIDORE, BISHOP OF SEVILLE.</i></div>

<p>I conceive that for many centuries after the beginning of the Christian
era the methods of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> ancient world were followed; and that private
libraries were arranged upon the Roman model in presses, with busts,
mottoes, and the like. Such was the library of Isidore, Bishop of Seville
(601-636). He was a voluminous writer, and seems to have had a voluminous
library, divided, if I interpret the arrangements correctly, among
fourteen presses, each ornamented by one or more portrait-busts or
medallions with suitable verses beneath them. The series concludes with a
notice <i>Ad interventorem</i>, a person whom we may call <i>A talkative
intruder</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Non patitur quenquam coram se scriba loquentem:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Non est hic quod agas, garrule, perge foras.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How useful such an admonition would be in modern libraries, if only it
could be enforced!</p>

<p>So late as the end of the twelfth century I find a Bishop who bequeathed
his library to a church describing it as "the contents of my press
(<i>plenarium armarium meum</i>)."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LIBRARY-TOWER IN THE LOUVRE.</i></div>

<p>Gradually, however, other methods came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> into fashion, due probably to the
introduction of the handsome bindings of which I have already spoken. Some
particulars have fortunately been preserved of the cost of fitting up a
certain tower in the Louvre between 1364 and 1368, to contain the books
belonging to Charles the Fifth of France, from which much useful
information may be extracted. The fittings of the older library in the
palace on the Isle de la Cit&eacute; were to be taken down and altered, and set
up in the new room. Two carpenters are paid for "having taken to pieces
all the cases (<i>bancs</i>) and two wheels (<i>roes</i>), that is revolving desks,
which were in the king's library in the palace, and transported them to
the Louvre...; and for having put all together again, and hung up the
cases (<i>lettrins</i>) in the two upper stages of the tower that looks toward
the Falconry, to put the king's books in; and for having panelled ... the
first of those two stories all round inside." Next a wire-worker
(<i>cagetier</i>) is paid "for having made trellises of wire in front of two
casements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> and two windows ... to keep out birds and other beasts
(<i>oyseaux et autres bestes</i>) by reason of, and protection for, the books
that shall be placed there."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LIBRARY-TOWER IN THE LOUVRE.</i></div>

<p>The words <i>bancs</i> and <i>lettrins</i>, which I have translated "cases," are
both frequently used. The first commonly denotes the cases in monastic
libraries, and the second is the usual word for a reading-desk. I think,
therefore, that the two words were applied to describe the same piece of
furniture, as "stall" and "desk" were with us. I am now going to shew you
two pictures of rooms arranged for study, which fit the above description
very well. The first is from a French translation of Boccaccio, <i>Des cas
des maleureux nobles hommes et femmes</i>, written and illuminated in
Flanders for King Henry the Seventh<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. Two gentlemen are studying at a
revolving desk, which can be raised or lowered by a screw. This is
evidently the "wheel" of the French king's library. Behind are their
books, either <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>resting on a desk hung against the wall (which is
panelled), or lying on a shelf beneath the desk. The second is also
Flemish, of the same date, from a copy of the <i>Miroir historial</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. It
represents a monk, probably the author of the book, writing in his study.
Behind him are three desks, one above the other, hung against the wall,
with books, as in the first picture, resting upon them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DESKS HUNG TO THE WALLS.</i></div>

<p>Some such arrangement as this must have been long in fashion. Libraries
such as those of Diane de Poitiers and Francis the First could not have
been bestowed in any other way; and in fact, when books are enriched with
metal-work, or have specially elaborate ornaments on their sides, a desk
of some sort is indispensable.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DESK AND CUPBOARD.</i></div>

<p>Humbler scholars had to content themselves with small cupboards
constructed in the thickness of the wall, or hung against it, as in the
picture I will next shew you, from a French translation of Valerius
Maximus, copied for <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>King Edward the Fourth, and dated 1479<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. You will
observe that the lower part of the window is fitted with trellises as in
the French king's library, not casements. The upper part only is glazed.</p>

<p>Another, and apparently very usual way of bestowing books, especially when
they were not numerous, was to place them in a sort of cupboard under the
sloping desk on which the owner read or wrote. An excellent specimen of
this device&mdash;which Richard de Bury specially commends, as being modelled
on the Ark, in the side of which the book of the Law was put&mdash;is to be
found in the <i>Ship of Fools</i> (1498). Another, of a curiously modern type,
occurs in an <i>Hours</i> in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, executed about
1445 for Isabel, Duchess of Brittany.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CONCLUSION.</i></div>

<p>Sometimes this book-cupboard supported a revolving desk, which could be
raised or depressed by the help of a central screw&mdash;like those I shewed
you just now; sometimes <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>the desk alone appears, with books laid on it.
The forms given to these pieces of furniture by the ingenuity of those who
made them are infinite; and they often include beautiful designs for
armchairs, fitted with desks for writing. I will shew you just one&mdash;not
because it is specially beautiful, but because it gives a quaint picture
of a scholar's room at the beginning of the fifteenth century<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CONCLUSION.</i></div>

<p>Here Time&mdash;as represented by yonder clock&mdash;holds up his finger and bids me
stop. I would fain have shewn you more pictures&mdash;but I hope that you have
seen a sufficient number to give you some idea of the surroundings in
which our forefathers read and wrote. I am sure that only in this way can
we realise that they were real living people&mdash;not mere names. Their modes
of thought were far different from ours; they may have wasted their time
in verbal subtleties, and uncritical tales; but the more we study what
they did, the more we shall <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>realise how laborious, how artistic, how
conscientious they were; and amid all the developments of the nineteenth
century, we shall gratefully confess that the Middle Ages rocked the
cradle of our knowledge, and that we "See but their hope become reality."</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
